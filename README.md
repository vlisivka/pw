Say, we scaled up to 1E1000, and looked out of window into sky, then
scaled out to 1E1000*2, then 1E1000*3, ... 1E1000*n, where n
approaches infinity. What we will see at average?

For example, if we saw at level 1 large but finite structure, then we
will saw nothing at level 2 and subsequent levels, thus we will see
nothing at average. Or we may see infinite rows of Universes like our,
just more dense packed at each level, thus we will see infinite
density when n -> infinity.

Or we may see something like our Universe, but just scaled up. Lot of
voids, lot of points of concentrated matter, but no infinite density,
or infinite energy, or infinite mass.

PS.
I quote paragraph from Leslie Ballentine book to to back my statement
that current QM is "OpenGL for Quantum world".

Chapter 2
The Formulation of
Quantum Mechanics
2.1
Basic Theoretical Concepts
Every physical theory involves some basic physical concepts, a mathemati-
cal formalism, and set of correspondence rules which map the physical concepts
onto the mathematical objects that represent them. The correspondence rules
are first used to express a physical problem in mathematical terms. Once the
mathematical version of the problem is formulated, it may be solved by purely
mathematical techniques that need not have any physical interpretation. The
formal solution is then translated back into the physical world by means of the
correspondence rules.
Sometimes this mapping between physical and mathematical objects is so
obvious that we need not think about it. In classical mechanics the position of
a particle (physical concept) is mapped onto a real number or a set of real num-
bers (mathematical concept). Although the notion of a real number in pure
mathematics is not trivial, this correspondence rule can be grasped intuitively
by most people, without any risk of confusion. The mathematical formalism
of quantum mechanics is much more abstract and less intuitive than that of
classical mechanics. The world does not appear to be made up of Hermi-
tian operators and infinite-dimensional state vectors, and we must give careful
and explicit attention to the correspondence rules that relate the abstract
mathematical formalism to observable reality.
