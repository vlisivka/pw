Ideas about Pilot Wave theory

First, I'm not a real scientist, I'm engineer, so it's very unlikely that I will pass anything. My goal is to recreate quantum experiments on macro-level, so it will be easy to study and understand them.

Here is my naive vision. It's how I see Universe now. (My English is weak. Help is welcome.)

Let me start with prerequisites.

1) 3D Universe is boring, because only 3 stable solutions are exist for 3D Universe: 1, 2, and 42. Only 3 dimensions + time, no more dimensions, because no stable solutions exists for 4 and more dimensions, so even if they exists, they will collapse to 3D Universe anyway, after finite time.

2) Universe can be scaled infinitely up and DOWN(!). Number of details will not change much at each level because of (1).

3) We are not moving in Space. We are propagating trough Space, because each our particle is surrounded with wave.

Explanation:

I remember that mathematicians invented an equation to describe infinite Universe which cannot "die" for infinite time. I.e. if somebody will try to squeeze all mater in one point to create infinite mass, he will fail regardless of the chosen method. Equation had unlimited number of solutions for 2D Universe, only 3 solutions for 3D Universe, and none solutions for more than 3 dimensions at all. Solutions for 3D Universe are 1, 2 and 42. It's obvious that our Universe is irregular, thus it is not 1 or 2, so only 42 is left.

So, because Universe is boring and repeats itself again and again, it has no top and bottom. If we scale up or down enough, we will see something very similar to our own level of scale. This means than number of particles per scale _at average_ must be constant or oscillate around constant value. I.e. if we have 1 particle at average per cube at scale 1, then we should have 2 particles of 0.125 mass at scale 0.5, and so on. (Numbers are made up). I.e. there must be about 10 dark planets with mass of Jupiter between us and nearest star, about 1000 planets with mass of Earth, and so on.

This means, if we scale down, that we are surrounded by gas of fine particles, which are floating in gas of even finer particles, and so on. So, in reality, there is no such thing as "empty space", we just not scaled down enough to find particles. Opposite is also true: there is no such thing as solid, everything is empty at about same rate.

If we scale up, we will find that we are floating in large blob of fine particles, which orbits and rotates, like our planet orbits and rotates, like our star orbits and rotates, like our galaxy orbits and rotates, and so on. This blob is also just tiny particle in even larger blob of even finest particles, which also orbits and rotates, and so on. Rule of right hand in electricity may be because of rotation of our nearest blob. We are in north hemisphere of that blob then. Maybe something is orbiting us too at some level(s).

Every thing contains infinite number of particles, if we scale down, and is part of infinite number of objects, if we scale up. Despite that, if we sum all that infinities, we will always have finite number. Even if we annihilate all particles in whole Universe we will still have constant amount of energy.

This also means that our Universe has digital nature. Every thing is made of finite number of particles at given level. Finite number of stars in galaxy, which has finite number of atoms, which has finite number of quarks, and so on. But number of levels is infinite.

This also means that every wave loses it energy, even light, because of digital nature of Universe. Wave is analog function, which cannot be represented correctly by digital world, thus each wave loses 0.5 of lowest digit at each peak at average, 1 whole digit per oscillation at average. So light, for example, will lose energy exponentially, shifting to red, then to microwaves, then to radio waves. Every wave has limited number of oscillations. Everything has limited life, even black holes, and will eventually release it energy back to the field, then condensate and form particles, atoms, clouds, stars, black holes again.

Now, let return to quantum level. Because each particle is surrounded with it wave, which has huge impact on particle itself, particles cannot move trough space freely. Particle waves are propagating, and they control behavior of particle, thus particles behaves like they are propagating too. In some cases, particle can lost connection with it wave and move without that limitation, or it does not have it wave at all, but particles at lower level have it anyway, otherwise they cannot interact and form particle at upper level.

So C is speed of wave in medium at quantum level. Lower level has much faster speed of interaction because sum of all energies is constant. If we will know masses of these sublevel particles, we will be able to calculate range of speeds they must have to interact to make propagation of our level waves at C.

Moreover, such limit, like C, let name id D, must be at upper level, where things like superclaster are just fine particle in a wave. D will be very low, because it limited by distance between stars and galaxies and speed of C. Interactions between superclusters cannot beat C, and because distances between superclasters is huge, any wave made of superclasters cannot beat D=C*1/(average distance to travel between superclusters to interact). Same rule holds for lower level, let call this speed B.

Now, the main question: why quantum particles are interacting at all? Because Universe is boring and repeats itself, we should already saw the answer, and it must be true at any level. First, let see how Universe conserves energy in 3D space at our level in stable way: the main ways to store energy are: move faster, rotate, orbit, bounce or oscillate, concentrate matter to form more powerful field. It looks like our choices are limited to rotation, orbiting, bouncing or oscillating, so, IMHO, quantum particles are using combination of these methods only.

IMHO, the most promising is rotation of eccentric mass, because it creates tiny vibrations and is susceptible to resonance. Moreover, because of Dzhanibekov effect, it also bounces and is even more susceptible to external influence, which may explain lot of quantum behavior.

Moreover, these vibrations may generate Casimir effect, which explains gravitation — it just the Casimir effect at a lower level.

    The Dzhanibekov is certainly pretty cool, but I do not really see the link...

    If you do a write-up of the proof of a connection and it passes muster, I imagine The American Journal of Physics would like to publish it (I am suggesting this journal because it focuses on problems of **pedagogical** interest). I would be happy to proof-read a draft if you wish. (Journals would not pay for the article - it is usually the opposite, they are paid in order to organize the editorial and peer-review efforts). But even if you do not publish it in a journal, I am certain that even just a blog post about the connection would be of great interest to people.

        Hi, Stefan,

        the answer to your question "why walking droplet simulates quantum behavior?" is probably "because of Dzhanibekov effect".

            > Your point about definition of spin and Stefan comment that my «prediction» is not prediction but guess lead me to think that I was wrong in my comment at HacketNews site. IMHO, «spin» is created by oscillation of charged droplet, not by their spinning. Each droplet jumps at same rate to same height, so they all produce same current, same magnetic field, and will be guided to same spot.

            I disagree on this point. There are a few ways the word spin can be used:

            1. atypical and rare use, but it can be used to refer to some classical angular momentum - something related to an angular velocity of a macroscopic solid body; the mathematical representation of this would be a vector that can have any magnitude (no upper limit if you have enough energy)

            2. atypical as well, for the quantized angular momentum due to some rotation (basically, the quantized version of the above); the mathematical representation is complicated, but it is something that can have only discrete values (without any upper limit either)

            3. typical usage (the one I believe you are trying to describe): a quality that certain types of particles have and that we can measure (with certain confusing intuition about it that might be the reason we disagree); it is discrete, either "up" or "down"; a particle can be in various superpositions of those states; mathematically it is equivalent to point 2. above if we limit the magnitude; mathematically it behaves in similar ways (but it is not equivalent to) what you would expect from a rotating ball that can rotate in only two ways.

            Hence, "spin" is not even defined for the droplets; It is not equivalent to the model of the droplet you are suggesting either - the movement of the droplets is not constrained to two states (it can be anything in between, even if only briefly) and it is not possible to have superpositions or entanglement (the actual show stopper).

            > Power of electric current of oscillating particle can be calculated, so shift of charged particle in nonlinear magnetic field can be predicted if charge, rate and height of bounce, mass of droplet, and parameters of magnetic field are known.

            Sure, if you have the laws of physics, you can calculate the evolution of a particle's position. But there is a difference between "it is possible to calculate in principle" and saying "it looks quantum" without proving step by step why it looks quantum.

            > IMHO, droplets are demonstrating quantum behavior because they are moving in small leaps: accelerate, then deaccelerate to 0, and again. If we extrapolate this to the electron, then electron, or something inside the electron, must oscillate at same rate. I saw few oscillators «to-center-and-back» made of 2, 3, 4 droplets — maybe they are key to understand internals of electron.

            But even if this is how it will actually move (and you have not explained why this is the case, hence me calling it a guess, not a proof or a prediction), there is nothing that mimics quantum behavior here. You can make up a classical theory with discrete positions and that would be interesting on its own, but for quantum behavior you need something that permits superpositions (a drop being in both states) or entanglement (the state of two droplets being co-dependent). The system you describe does not look like an electron, hence while a nice toy problem, it is not something you can expect to explain its properties.

            > Sorry if I writing something stupid or incorrect, because I'm engineer, not a scientist, and I still learning English language.

            Do not worry, your English is perfectly functional. And engineers have contributed plenty to science. However if we are not on the same page and not working with the same tools it would be impossible for me to explain my claims. You are trying to prove something but currently you do not have the tools to define what it is and you are relying on intuition which does not work in this regime. There is an amazing amount of fascinating topics to be explored, but you need those basic tools first. If you are interested I would be happy to help you with some of the books I suggested or point you to online courses on the topic, but there is nothing I can say that would convince you of my arguments if we do not define rigorously what we are talking about (which we have not done yet).
